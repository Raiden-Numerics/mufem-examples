# Compumag Team-20: 3D Static Force Problem

## Introduction

The *Compumag Team 20 problem*[1] is a non-linear magnetostatic case to validate the force generated on a pole.
The problem exhibits strong nonlinearity, which requires a robust solver.

The *Yoke* and *Pole* are iron materials with a BH curve with a Rayleigh region and saturation.

| BH Curve | BH Curve (zoomed) |
| --- | --- |
| ![Residuals](./data/bh_curve.png) | ![Magnetic Flux Density](./data/bh_curve_low.png) |
| | The BH curve has a strong Rayleigh region. |


The excitation coil is a wound (stranded) coil with 1000 turns. We measure the force acting on the pole for different coil currents ranging
from $I=0\text{A}$ to $I=5\text{A}$ (in total 11 measurements).


We run [case.py](case.py) inside bash with
```bash
> tput reset; ~/mufem/Release/mufem/pymufem.sh case.py 
...

```

The script [case.py](case.py) stores the force created for each assigned coil current and generates a plot showing the dependency of the
force vs. the coil current:

We find a good match to the experimental and numerical values reported in [2] and [3].
